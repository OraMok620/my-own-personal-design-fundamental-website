    <ul><li>Coding worksheet 1</li></ul>

    <p>In coding worksheet 1, I learnt how to use GitHub, and that was my first time to use it. GitHub is useful as you save folders or files you no need to worry about lost them. Furthermore, in week 1, also first time to create website by using html tag, from coding worksheet I know for a website, it must include "html" in the beginning and "/html" at the end of the html sheet, also a basic website there must include "body" and "/body" which let you add text or images inside. </p>

    <ul><li>Coding worksheet 2</li></ul>

    <p>In coding worksheet 2, I learnt block level elements, inline elements and how to insert link also image in html document. To create a web page, firstly it should include “head””/head” before you add “body” tag, inside “head” tag, there are all the metadata, like the page title, which title tag is “title””/title”, also any CSS stylesheets, and other things that are required to render the page. Secondly, for the “body” part, it can add “h” which for heading, there are 6 levels of heading, ranging from 1 to 6, since there are heading, there also a tag “p” which stand for paragraph. In addition to text, not only can make heading and paragraph, but it also allowed to make list, there are 2 type of list, “ol” tag and “ul” tag, the difference between these two types of lists is “ol” is an ordered list. It lists things with numbers or letters. But what is important for both list tags is to add “li””/li” inside. Thirdly, after reading the worksheet and following the instructions on worksheet, I found that inserting link or image not difficult than I thought. To add image, can’t forget most important thing, the alt is super important for accessibility, screen readers and people who are using devices where the image is not being pulled in.</p>

    <ul><li>Coding worksheet 3</li></ul>

    <p>In coding worksheet 3, I learnt how to use css stylesheet.  Beginning with inserting css stylesheet to html code, just need to add the tag “link rel = ‘stylesheet’ href=’styles.css’” inside head tag, styles.css name could be changed. I think css is easy to understand, css can change font style, alignment of elements, background color, there still a lot of things you can change by using css. Furthermore, using “class” could change the specific items that you want to make different with others. Finally, using css can make a big change to web page, so trying to make different changes is important for designing a website, you maybe found inspiration when you are trying all functions in css.</p>
