    <ul><li>Coding worksheet 1</li></ul>

    <p>In coding worksheet 1, I learnt how to use GitHub, and that was my first time to use it. GitHub is useful as you save folders or files you no need to worry about lost them. Furthermore, in week 1, also first time to create website by using html tag, from coding worksheet I know for a website, it must include "html" in the beginning and "/html" at the end of the html sheet, also a basic website there must include "body" and "/body" which let you add text or images inside. </p>
