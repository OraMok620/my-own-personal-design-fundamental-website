    <p class="RP">Poster incorporate contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.  The contrast could be seen from the colour of the poster, as the poster mostly used black and white. Secondly, there are repetition in colour also shapes, such as squares and rectangles. Thirdly, alignment for text in center.
